    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive directory dashboard. This structure was chosen for maximum usability, directly addressing the user's need to find and filter manufacturer information, which is a significant improvement over a static Excel sheet. The layout consists of three main parts: 1) A top control panel with category filters and a search bar for immediate interaction. 2) A visual analytics section with a bar chart to provide a quick overview of the manufacturing landscape by specialty. 3) A responsive grid of manufacturer 'cards' that displays detailed information. The user flow is simple: view all, filter by category or search by name to dynamically update the visible cards. This task-oriented design makes finding specific information efficient and intuitive. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Manufacturer Directory: Report Info -> List of all manufacturers and their details. Goal -> Organize, Inform, Allow search. Viz/Presentation -> A responsive grid of cards created with HTML/Tailwind. Interaction -> Users can filter the cards by clicking category buttons or using a search bar. This is powered by vanilla JavaScript that toggles the visibility of the cards. Justification -> This is a highly scannable and user-friendly pattern for presenting directory information, far superior to a static table. Library/Method -> Vanilla JS, HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        2. Manufacturer Specialization Distribution: Report Info -> The number of manufacturers for each part category. Goal -> Compare. Viz/Presentation -> A vertical bar chart. Interaction -> Hovering over the bars reveals tooltips with the exact count for that category. Justification -> A bar chart is the most effective visualization for comparing counts across distinct categories, providing an immediate understanding of market concentration. Library/Method -> Chart.js on a Canvas element.
        3. AI-Powered Email Draft: Report Info -> Manufacturer name, category, contact. Goal -> Facilitate quick communication. Viz/Presentation -> Modal with a text area for the generated email. Interaction -> Click a button on a manufacturer card to open the modal, LLM generates text, user can copy. Justification -> Streamlines the inquiry process, making the directory more actionable. Library/Method -> Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash), Vanilla JS, HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        4. AI-Powered Product Pitch: Report Info -> Manufacturer name, category. Goal -> Generate marketing content. Viz/Presentation -> Modal with a text area for the generated pitch. Interaction -> Click a button on a manufacturer card to open the modal, LLM generates text, user can copy. Justification -> Provides quick, AI-generated marketing copy, adding value for users looking to understand or promote products. Library/Method -> Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash), Vanilla JS, HTML, Tailwind CSS.
        5. Direct Call Feature: Report Info -> Manufacturer phone number. Goal -> Enable direct contact. Viz/Presentation -> Button with a phone icon/text. Interaction -> Click the button to initiate a phone call. Justification -> Directly connects users to manufacturers, improving efficiency. Library/Method -> HTML `tel:` link, Tailwind CSS.
        This design adheres to all constraints, using interactive HTML/JS for the directory and Chart.js for the visualization. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
